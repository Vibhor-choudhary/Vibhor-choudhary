## 👋 Welcome!

AI Tools & Automation Enthusiast (Building in Public) | Self-employed

I explore, build, and share practical automation and AI workflows. My focus: converting complex problems into actionable, tested solutions that help both organizations and individuals accelerate with GenAI and automation. Every workflow or insight I share has been built, broken, debugged, and rebuilt—so others can skip the guesswork.
